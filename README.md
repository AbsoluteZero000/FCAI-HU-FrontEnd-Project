Final project of introduction to Information Technology course - Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence - Helwan University, [Fall 2019]

## welcome everybody!

This project is the final project for an Introduction to Information Technology course, and this is my first project in my technical field, and this is my first experience in web development.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap to build the website.

I would like to clarify that the project has many errors.. 
but it is my first experience.. 
so I am very proud of it and that is why I decided to upload it and share it with you!
